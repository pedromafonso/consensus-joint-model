To reproduce the simulation study, follow the steps outlined below.

Step 1: Data Generation and Model Fitting

Execute 'sim_code.R' to generate data and perform model fitting. This script accomplishes the following tasks: generates data, splits the data into subsets, fits the jm() model to each data subset.


Step 2: Consensus from MCMC Samples

Execute 'sim_funs.R'. This script is responsible for: obtaining consensus from the MCMC samples generated by 'sim_code.R'.


Important Notes:

Review the code in both sim_code.R and sim_funs.R to customize settings or parameters as needed for your specific simulation scenario. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further assistance in conducting the simulation study.
